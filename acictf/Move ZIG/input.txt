  This program is going to ask you to convert among 6 different bases a total
  of 500 times.  Each question is placed inside of lines delimited by 78
  '-' characters.  The first line of each question indicates the base we are
  giving to you as well as the base we expect the result in and looks like:
          [src_base] -> [answer base]
  The next line of the question is the source text that we want you to convert
  into the new base. Your answer should be followed by a newline character.

  All of the encodings treat an underlying printable ASCII string as a
  big-endian number.  If that doesn't make a lot of sense, don't worry about
  it: most of the tools you'd look to use (Python, websites, etc.) generally
  assume this anyways.  Except for 'raw' and 'b64', there will never be
  leading 0s at the start of the answer.

  Formatting key:
          raw = the unencoded ASCII string (contains only printable characters
                    that are not whitespace)
          b64 = standard base64 encoding (see 'base64' unix command)
          hex = hex (base 16) encoding (case insensitive)
          dec = decimal (base 10) encoding
          oct = octal (base 8) encoding
          bin = binary (base 2) encoding (should consist of ASCII '0' and '1')
