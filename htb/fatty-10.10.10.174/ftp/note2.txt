Dear members, 

we are currently experimenting with new java layouts. The new client uses a static layout. If your
are using a tiling window manager or only have a limited screen size, try to resize the client window
until you see the login from.

Furthermore, for compatibility reasons we still rely on Java 8. Since our company workstations ship Java 11
per default, you may need to install it manually.

Best regards, 
qtc
