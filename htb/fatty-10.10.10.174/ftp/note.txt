Dear members, 

because of some security issues we moved the port of our fatty java server from 8000 to the hidden and undocumented port 1337. 
Furthermore, we created two new instances of the server on port 1338 and 1339. They offer exactly the same server and it would be nice
if you use different servers from day to day to balance the server load. 

We were too lazy to fix the default port in the '.jar' file, but since you are all senior java developers you should be capable of 
doing it yourself ;)

Best regards,
qtc
